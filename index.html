            Parallax scrolling is a computer graphics technique used by web designers to create a faux-3D effect. As users scroll down a webpage, different layers of content or backgrounds move at different speeds, and this creates an optical illusion. Using parallax scrolling is not a new technique. In the early 1980s, game designers working on Super Mario Bros. used parallax graphics to create a sensation of depth. 

Today, parallax scrolling has become more of a trend in the web design world—and for good reason. Scrolling is easier than clicking, and a well-designed parallax effect engages users to scroll for more information.

            There are a few different ways designers can create parallax website designs. The first is to dive into pure CSS to create it. If you want to follow this approach, you should use a container element and add a background image to this container. Then you should use the “background-attachment: fixed” CSS property to create the actual parallax effect. You can find a working example at W3Schools.

            Parallax graphics are ideal for storytelling. Good design is all about communication—and when we design websites, we want to communicate with our visitors and tell a compelling story about our product, service, or brand. Parallax scrolling allows us to immerse our website visitors in unique online experiences. It’s even possible to create a one-page website where visitors can read an entire story about your product or brand without navigating to multiple pages.
